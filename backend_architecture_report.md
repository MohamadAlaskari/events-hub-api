# EventsHub API Backend: Architecture and Implementation Analysis

## Abstract

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of the EventsHub API backend, a robust event management system built using the NestJS framework. The system implements a modern microservices-oriented architecture with comprehensive authentication, event discovery, and user preference management capabilities. The backend serves as the core service layer for a full-stack event management application, providing RESTful APIs for user authentication, event browsing, and personalization features.

## 1. Introduction

The EventsHub API represents a modern approach to event management systems, leveraging contemporary web technologies and architectural patterns to deliver a scalable and maintainable backend service. Built on the NestJS framework, the system demonstrates best practices in enterprise-grade application development, including modular architecture, comprehensive security measures, and robust error handling.

### 1.1 System Overview

The EventsHub API is designed as a comprehensive backend service that facilitates event discovery and management through a well-structured RESTful API. The system integrates with external event data providers (specifically Ticketmaster API) while maintaining its own user management and personalization features.

### 1.2 Technology Stack

The backend is built using the following primary technologies:
- **Framework**: NestJS (Node.js framework)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Database**: MySQL with TypeORM ORM
- **Authentication**: JWT with Passport.js strategies
- **Email Service**: Nodemailer with custom templates
- **API Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI 3.0
- **Deployment**: Vercel serverless platform

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Modular Architecture

The EventsHub API follows a modular architecture pattern, organizing functionality into distinct feature modules. This approach promotes code reusability, maintainability, and separation of concerns.

#### 2.1.1 Core Modules

The system is structured around five primary modules:

1. **Authentication Module (`auth/`)**: Handles user registration, login, JWT token management, and email verification
2. **User Module (`user/`)**: Manages user profiles, preferences, and account information
3. **Event Module (`event/`)**: Interfaces with external event APIs and provides event discovery functionality
4. **Favorite Module (`favorite/`)**: Manages user event preferences and favorites
5. **Mail Module (`mail/`)**: Handles email communications including verification and notifications

#### 2.1.2 Shared Components

The system includes a common utilities layer (`common/`) containing:
- Custom decorators for API documentation
- Global exception filters
- Configuration services
- Type definitions and constants

### 2.2 Database Architecture

The system employs a relational database design using MySQL with TypeORM as the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool. The database schema consists of two primary entities:

#### 2.2.1 User Entity

```typescript
@Entity()
export class User {
    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn("uuid")
    id: string;

    @Column({length: 40})
    name: string;
    
    @Column({unique: true})
    email: string;

    @Column()
    password: string;

    @Column({ default: false })
    isEmailVerified: boolean;

    @Column({
        type: "enum",
        enum: CountryCode,
        nullable: false,
        default: CountryCode.DE,
    })
    country: CountryCode;

    @Column({ type: 'varchar', nullable: true })
    refreshTokenHash?: string | null;

    @OneToMany(() => Favorite, favorite => favorite.user)
    favorites: Favorite[];
}
```

#### 2.2.2 Favorite Entity

```typescript
@Entity()
@Unique(['userId', 'eventId'])
export class Favorite {
    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn("uuid")
    id: string;

    @Column()
    eventId: string;

    @ManyToOne(() => User, user => user.favorites, {
        onDelete: 'CASCADE'
    })
    user: User;

    @Column()
    userId: string;
}
```

The database design implements proper normalization with foreign key relationships and unique constraints to ensure data integrity.

## 3. Authentication and Security

### 3.1 JWT-Based Authentication

The system implements a comprehensive JWT-based authentication mechanism with the following features:

#### 3.1.1 Token Types

The authentication system utilizes three distinct token types:

1. **Access Token**: Short-lived token (30 minutes default) for API access
2. **Refresh Token**: Long-lived token (2 days default) for token renewal
3. **Email Verification Token**: Time-limited token (1 hour default) for email verification

#### 3.1.2 Authentication Flow

The authentication process follows these steps:

1. **User Registration**: 
   - User provides credentials via `/auth/signup`
   - System creates user account with hashed password
   - Email verification token is generated and sent
   - User must verify email before login

2. **User Login**:
   - Credentials validated against stored hash
   - Access and refresh tokens issued upon successful authentication
   - Refresh token hash stored in database for security

3. **Token Refresh**:
   - Client provides refresh token to `/auth/refresh`
   - System validates token and issues new token pair
   - Previous refresh token invalidated

4. **Logout**:
   - Refresh token hash removed from database
   - Client-side tokens invalidated

### 3.2 Password Security

The system implements bcrypt for password hashing with configurable salt rounds, ensuring secure storage of user credentials.

### 3.3 Email Verification

A comprehensive email verification system ensures user account validity:
- JWT-based verification tokens with configurable expiration
- HTML email templates for professional communication
- Automatic account activation upon verification

## 4. API Design and Documentation
